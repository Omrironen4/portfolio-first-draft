                  Welcome to my work-based portfolio web page! My name is Omri Ronen and I am embarking on a new journey of web development. I love learning new things, and I also love challenges, so I hope I chose the right path! I'm originally from Israel, but I've been living in the states for many years now. I am fluent in Hebrew, and I have a strong understanding in various languages. My hobbies inolve being in the outdoors such as hiking and surfing. I love to cook and play guitar whenever I have the free time.
