/* The tabs class is using absolute positioning to completely remove the tabs from the document flow, and it's useful for sticking something in a specific position but you donâ€™t want anything else to move around it. Position absolute allows you to do top left right and bottom to it, but I only adjusted the top and right to get the right positioning. The display is inline-flex because I want the tabs to be in line and not stacked on top of each other, and when I adjust the screen the tabs move accordingly with the flex. The width of 300px allowed for more spaces between the tabs because they were too close togethe.*/
